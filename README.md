# vtmb-tweaks
Various small engine-level tweaks for Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines.  
* no_tracers - disables the bullet tracer effect for both NPCs and the player.
* no_corpse_despawn - prevents NPC corpses from despawning until a level transition occurs (a loading screen).
* stackable_weapons - allows weapons to stack in the inventory. "is_stackable" must be set to 1 in weapon definition files in vdata/items.
* npcs_drop_all_weapons - makes NPCs drop all weapons on death instead of only the last one used.  ]
  
Loader.exe is required (included with all versions of Unofficial Patch and major mods). To install, place the .vtm files in Bin/loader.
